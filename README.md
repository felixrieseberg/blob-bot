a Slack channel. It also supports various commands allowing users to see
activities directly in Slack.

#### Configuring the Strava Integration

Vist https://www.strava.com/settings/api and create a new API application.
Copy the "Access Token" and set it as the `BB_STRAVA_TOKEN` environment variable.

#### Configuring the Slack App

Visit https://api.slack.com/apps and click "Create a new app". This bot will
need two features: "Incoming Webhooks" and "Slash Commands".

Both features are optional, the bot can be used just as a slash command, or
just as tool that posts new activities to a Slack channel.

*Incoming Webhooks*: Add a new webhook to your app. Select a channel you want
the bot to post new activities in. Store the URL, you will need it later.

*Slash Commands*: Add a new slash command of your choice and give it the
endpoint `https://address-to-your-app.com/webhook`.
